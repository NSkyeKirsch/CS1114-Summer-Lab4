Of all the health risks a growing child may face, air pollution may be the least conspicuous.
Around the world, driven by massive wildfires, belching smokestacks, and the compounding effects of climate change, contaminated air remains a growing and serious hazard.
While the April 2022 marking of Earth Day reflects the public's appetite to protect the environment on behalf of a new generation, U.S. action to safeguard air quality specifically has been sporadic since the first Earth Day in 1970.
That year, major revisions to the Clean Air Act were passed, and 1978 brought a federal ban on fluorocarbon gasses in aerosol products.
Though interwoven with ongoing United Nations work to combat climate change, the global health hazards from breathing polluted air have spread widely and increased to levels not experienced in decades.
To address these concerning trends, researchers in NYUâ€™s Marron Institute have partnered with NASA atmospheric scientists and are now developing a streamlined air quality monitoring index. It will allow local and regional governments as well as individual households anywhere in the world to size-up the risk that children in particular would face playing outdoors or heading off to school on any given day.
